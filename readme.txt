LIMITATIONS:
All shape options (including Radial) are functional. HOWEVER, because the radial setup is very intensive,
it may on your machine, as it did for mine, cause some buffering and rendering issues AFTER the radial
is run. Any shapes produced before the radial should have no issue.

Some issues I've experienced after producing the radial:
- Unable to draw points after drawing radial. Can draw all other shapes. Once another shape drawn,
  then can draw points.
- After drawing radial, buffers may act glitchy where some objects may disappear to the back buffer, or the back buffer
  may randomly replace the front buffer.
- The suggested order is to run all other non-radial shapes first (as they run fine),
  then proceed with radial and RESTART the app to draw any other shapes. Clearing the screen MAY
  also resolve the issue (my results were inconclusive).
